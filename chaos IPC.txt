IPC flow:

SERVER:
* creates service with a specific protocol name, gets a service handle
* waits for any event
* when client connects to service handle server gets an event on the service handle with action ServiceConnected and a channel handle for the connection




















CHANNEL MEMORY LAYOUT

channels are full duplex, there are two buffers (completely user land managed), one for sending and one for receiving. a buffer uses a memory layout that allows message queues
